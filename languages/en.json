    "vietucBioDesc": "Founded in 2000, VietUC began as a modest operation with about 20 employees, processing 60 tons of raw cassava daily. Back then, much of the work involved manual labor, including lifting baskets of cassava to feed into choppers and grinders.<br/>As demand grew, we invested in machinery to enhance productivity. By 2008, our factory was producing approximately 150 tons of starch daily. With continuous expansion, we reached a milestone of 200 tons per day in 2010, and by 2012, this increased to 250 tons.<br/>Today, VietUC employs 100 dedicated workers, processes up to 1,200 tons of cassava daily, and produces 300 tons of high-quality starch. Our commitment to innovation and efficiency allows us to maintain competitive costs while ensuring premium starch quality.<br/>At VietUC, we are proud of our journey and remain focused on meeting the growing needs of our clients with excellence and reliability.",
